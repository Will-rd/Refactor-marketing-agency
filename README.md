# Refactor-marketing-agency

## Description
   - This page had unstructured semantic HTML elements that needed to be corrected for organizational purposes
   - The images were not compatible with accesibility standards so alternate text was added to describe them.
   this also comes in handy if the image links were ever to have issues. The text would then be displayed

## Usage
   - After clicking the link below inspect the page from your web browser and noticed that the various semantic elements are organized
   according to their place on the page.
   - Here is a link to the deployed webpage [link] (https://will-rd.github.io/Refactor-marketing-agency/)
